<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Scraptopia is an engaging and educational game developed in Godot Engine, designed to teach players the importance of proper waste segregation. In this game, players take on the role of a hero who helps five gays clean their properties by picking up trash and sorting it into the correct bins. 

The game combines environmental education with puzzle-solving mechanics, making it both entertaining and informative. By completing the game, players not only restore the beauty of the land but also gain a deeper understanding of how to manage waste responsibly in real life.
